# Motivation

- The US is somewhat unique within advanced economies in the design of the US safety net. The system is very federalized with various levels of government running programs. 

- People have to apply to a host of programs and rules are not harmonized across programs. So low take-up is more of an issue in the US than in many other places.

- Thus, take-up of social programs is a hot topic in public economics yet understudied.

---

# Motivation

## Theoretical literature 
- Incomplete take up-sometimes caused by ordeals-could be efficient if programs can be designed to deter those who don’t need programs/target those who need them. .smallest[(.red[Ackerlof, 1978; Nichols &amp; Zeckhauser, 1982; Besley &amp; Coate, 1992; Kleven &amp; Kopczuk, 2011])]

- Robert Moffitt (.red[1983]) introduced the idea of stigma (either I am less likely to participate because it is bad to use benefits or because others might judge me). 




---

# Motivation

- More recently, behavioral science has introduced the idea of limited bandwidth or scarcity which means more needy individuals could be deterred by complexity or ordeals or hassle costs and they might deter efficiency (e.g., .red[Bertrand, Mullainathan, &amp; Shafir, 2004]).

- Political science/public administration has introduced the idea of administrative burden (.red[Herd and Moynihan, 2019]). Some government actors choose to make it hard to get onto programs intentionally, surely some do because of limited capacity. Goal of former is to limit use, not maximize a social welfare function.




---

# Motivation
## Which model tells us how people act?

- More recently, some empirical work looking at specific settings to understand take-up and who is marginal participant?

- .hi[Neoclassical model:] People make decisions balancing costs and benefits in a utility maximizing framework. Incomplete take-up is a function of incomplete information, stigma (either concerns about whether you should participate or about how others should judge you), or transactions costs (it is more costly to enroll if you have to travel more, or the documentation or time costs are higher). 

- .hi[Behavioral science  model:] Limited bandwidth or stress impairs people. Suggests incomplete take-up might be harmful or inefficient.

---

# Empirical Work

- .hi[Daponte, Sanders, &amp; Taylor (1999):] Asked people if they thought they were eligible for Food Stamps and found many were confused.

- .hi[Bhargava and Manoli (2015):] RCT looking at how information, inducing stigma, inducing burden, etc. affect take-up of EITC among eligible non recipients in California.


- .hi[Deshpande and Li (2019):] Closing SSA offices affects take-up, mixed findings about who is deterred. But caveat about costs.

- .hi[Administrative burden.] Papers on online applications (UI - .red[Stange and Ebenstein, 2010]), other non economics papers in Political Science/Public Administration. Evidence during COVID about WIC participation being affected by pick up and enrollment rules (in person/not).

- Big literature in other settings (retirement, filing taxes, information for students). 



---
#Empirical Work

.hi[Finkelstein and Notowidigdo (2019):] RCT on Medicaid participants not on SNAP if eligible

- How did information and application help affect take-up?

- Add model for social welfare incorporating social costs and perceptions of costs of application (so looking at who takes up is not enough). 

- Assistance `\(&gt;\)` information `\(&gt;\)` status quo.

- Compliers are better off.

- Worse targeting
  
- Quantify costs of assessing eligibility?
  - Understanding expense of eligibility assessment would help determine size of wedge between social and private welfare
  - Efforts to cut cost of eligibility would help shrink wedge

# Our Contribution

- We are looking at a setting where multiple actors are relevant. This includes stores participating in programs and state offices where people sign up for SNAP. Most of the literature has looked at one of these in isolation with limited focus on private actors. (.smallest[.red[Handbury &amp; Moshary, 2021; Beatty, Bitler, and van Der Werf, 2021; Rossin-Slater, 2013; Meckel, 2020; Ambrozek, 2021]]).

- We have linked Census data on where residential location to comprehensive administrative data on program take-up by location. We link this to data on the relevant agents who affect take-up (i.e., SNAP offices and SNAP-authorized retailers). So we can learn how program administration locations affect take-up and how availability of benefits at stores accepting them affects take-up and use. Couldn’t do as convincingly with most surveys due to limited sample sizes  and also data quality issues. Also have spending amounts which are rarely in survey data.



---
# Our Contribution

- We can look at the population within states in our data and don’t have to focus samples with limited generalizability (previous RCT literature).

- We have rich administrative data on other programs and mobility.

- We have samples which permit us to explore staggered adoption designs.

- This is a first stage for work to come, on outcomes.

---
# Exogeneity of our Variation

- Why is it exogenous where stores and SNAP offices open and close?

- Plausible that when and where to select may be a function of general neighborhood characteristics
  - However, we look at households extremely close to these locations (&lt;1 mile)
  - Unlikely to target neighborhood characteristics in close vicinity

- We have shown evidence about how each of these doesn’t affect participation in other programs as a placebo and how more people with various characteristics aren’t coming into locations where these changes occur.

- We also plan to use data on Dun &amp; Bradstreet firms and the locations of SNAP offices/WIC clinics/ and stores to see that openings and closings are not affected by aggregate trends within locations in stores.

# Empirical Design

- Characteristics of SNAP recipients near SNAP offices relatively similar across types   
  - **Caveat:** .hi-blue[Urban offices] tend to open in whiter neighborhoods and close in lower-income neighborhoods

- We leverage panel design that hinges on whether timing of openings/closings is exogenous
  - Specifically, we require that unobserved determinants of SNAP participation are not trending differentially for office types

- Test this directly with event studies

---

# Empirical Design

## Preferred Specification - TWFE

`$$y_{it} = \sum_{\tau}\beta_\tau 1(t-E_i = \tau) + \gamma_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$`
- `\(i\)` SNAP office
- `\(t\)` calendar year
- `\(E_i\)` year of opening/closing
  
---

# Empirical Design

`$$y_{it} = \sum_{\tau}\beta_\tau 1(t-E_i = \tau)+  \gamma_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$`

- Run on a panel balanced over main event times `\(\tau \in [-3,3]\)`

- Coefficients estimated for all event times, but only report `\(\tau \in [-3,3]\)`

- Cluster by SNAP office

- Sample includes all SNAP offices and event time is only calculated for treated offices (i.e., opening or closing)

- Test robustness to heterogeneous TE a la **de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille (2020)**

- Post-treatment event study coefficients averaged (standard errors - delta method)

# Conclusion

- Access to SNAP offices meaningfully increases program participation

- Particularly important for those families without income

- Interesting because many states are fully online with active help phone lines

- Face-to-face assistance may provide additional aid overcoming administrative burden?

---
# Next Steps

- Qualitatively examine mechanisms for why office may matter

- Similar analysis for distance to SNAP-authorized retailers and businesses more generally (D&amp;B)

- Robustness to population changes

- Mobility outcomes

- Use as IV to explore impact of SNAP on other outcomes
